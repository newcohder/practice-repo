        This is a webpage about cows. Cows are big and beefy. Cows like to roam. Farmers milk cows. People drink the milk. Cheese comes from cows also. But, cheese could also come from goats. This isn't a website about goats. Cows. Cows are delicious.

    <p id="p2">
        Some people don't like to eat beef. They eat veggies. Cows eat veggies also. Cows can be vegan, can they?
    </p>

    <p id="p3">
        Cows can be whatever they want to be. But usually, the choice is not theirs. Most cows become beef patties.
